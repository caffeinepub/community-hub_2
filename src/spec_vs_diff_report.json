  "summary": "The diff implements all 6 requirements with comprehensive frontend and backend code. The implementation includes user profiles (REQ-1), post creation and feed (REQ-2), like functionality (REQ-3), commenting system (REQ-4), vibrant UI with warm colors and rounded design (REQ-5), and image asset display (REQ-6). No missing requirements were identified. However, there are hallucinated features that were explicitly marked as non-goals in the BuildRequest.",
